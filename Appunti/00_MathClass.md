## Metodi 
* ```Math.abs(double/int)```: returns the absolute value of a double/int value;
* ```Math.ceil(double)```: returns the smallest (closest to negative infinity) double value that is greater than or equal to the argument and is equal to a mathematical integer;
* ```Math.floor(double)```: returns the largest (closest to positive infinity) double value that is less than or equal to the argument and is equal to a mathematical integer;
* ```Math.max(double/int, double/int)```: returns the greater of two double/int values;
* ```Math.min(double/int, double/int)```: returns the smaller of two double/int values;
* ```Math.pow(double, double)```: returns the value of the first argument raised to the power of the second argument;
* ```Math.PI()```: returns the value of pi (3,14159...);
* ```Math.random()```: returns a double value with a positive sign, greater than or equal to 0.0 and less than 1.0;
* ```Math.round(double)```: returns the closest long to the argument, with ties rounding to positive infinity;
* ```Math.sqrt(double)```: returns the correctly rounded positive square root of a double value;
